# Description
This directory contains code used in the Tobin Center's / Ken Gillingham's project on EV Charging Infrastructure. 

# Data
Note: All the data referenced in the scripts is to be found on the Dropbox under `tobin_working_data`. A small number of files related to the demand estimation only, might be found on the AutomakerStrategies Drobox owned by A/Prof Stephanie Weber at UColorado Boulder (but I believe all such references to the other Dropbox have now been removed).
