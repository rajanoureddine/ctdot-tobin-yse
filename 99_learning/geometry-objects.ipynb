    "ingredients of working with spatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the library package [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/) has\n",
    "become the standard tool for working with geo-spatial objects, and for carruing\n",
    "out a range of geometric operations. A basic understanding of how *shapely*\n",
    "works is paramount for using higher-level tools, such as, for instance,\n",
    "[geopandas](https://geopandas.pydata.org/) (see [lesson 2](../lesson-2/overview))\n",

    "set forward in the [Open Geospatial Consortium’s *Simple Feature Access*\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometric objects are described and constructed by *coordinate tuples*\n",
    "\n",
    "Even more fundamental than that, **coordinate tuples** are what is used to\n",
    "define the geometric fundamentals point, line, and polygon. Coordinate tuples\n",

    "is a Python data structure that consists of a number of values separated by\n",
    "commas. Coordinate pairs are often represented as a tuple. For example,\n",
    "`(60.192059, 24.945831)` is a tuple with two values, `(1,)` a tuple with one\n",
    "value (note the comma that distinguishes a one-value tuple from a mathematical\n",

    "Other sequence data types are lists and ranges. Tuples have many similarities\n",
    "with lists and ranges, but they are often used for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are\n",
    "[immutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable), which means\n",

    "\n",
    "(#linestrings)=\n",
    "### LineStrings\n",
    "\n",
    "**LineString** geometries (and the related **LinearRing**s) represent lines.\n",
    "They are defined by a sequence of points. By connecting the points in order,\n",
    "a line is formed, if the first and last point are the same, a linear ring.\n",
    "Consequently, to describe a *LineString*, at least two points are necessary, \n",

    "(#polygons)=\n",
    "### Polygons\n",

    "Finally, **Polygon** geometries represent an area. A polygon is defined by\n",
    "exactly one *LinearRing* as its circumference, and any number of additional\n",
    "*LinearRing*s representing holes that are cut out. As such, at minimum, three\n",
    "coordinate tuples are needed to define a Polygon (but it becomes more difficult\n",
    "quickly, as, naturally, the coordinates that define the holes have to lie within\n",
    "the exterior *LinearRing*, and also must not intersect each other).\n",

    "\n",

    "of attributes of geometries. For instance, you can:\n",
    "- create lines and polygons from a set of points\n",
    "- calculate the area, length, perimeter, etc., of geometries\n",
    "- perform geometric operations on a set of geometries, for instance, merging\n",
